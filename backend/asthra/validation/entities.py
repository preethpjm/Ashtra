"""Entities for XSD-validated documents (e.g. S1000D files that pull in the ISO entity
sets through a parameter entity in their DOCTYPE, then use &deg; &mdash; ...).

The document is re-parsed with entity expansion ON but loading OFF-network and confined
to the schema package: external entity files resolve only through the package catalog
(by public id, URL, or bare file name). Anything else is refused (XXE), and libxml2's
amplification limit stops entity bombs. The source text is not changed, so line numbers
stay exact."""
